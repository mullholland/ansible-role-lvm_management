## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/mullholland/ansible-role-ansible-generator/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  # vars:
  #   example_var: "value"
  roles:
    - role: "{{ lookup('env', 'MOLECULE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY') }}"
```


## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/mullholland/ansible-role-ansible-generator/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
---
lvm_management_max_gap_kb: 1024
lvm_management_devices: []
#  - partition: /dev/vda      # Which HDD should be resized
#    number: 2                # which partition number should be resized

lvm_management_lvm_configuration: []
#  - name: "lv_root"  # Name of the logical volume group
#    size: "10G"      # What should happen to the colume
#                     # 10G => sets the size to 10G regardless of the current size (WARNING DO NOT SHRINK IT!!!!!!)
#                     # +10G => adds 10G after each ansible run (NOT idempotent!!!)
#                     # +100%FREE => adds all Free Space to the lv
#    vg: "system"     # The name of the VolumeGroup the LV resides
#    fstype: "ext4"   # The filesystem the lv uses
```
